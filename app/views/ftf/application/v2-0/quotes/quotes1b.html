 <p class="govuk-body">All quotes or tenders must:<br>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>come from different, independent suppliers who are not linked to each other or to your business through shared ownership or control</li>
    <li>be sourced independently by you or your agent (a supplier cannot source quotes from other suppliers on your behalf)</li>
    <li>include a detailed and itemised breakdown of costs</li>
    <li>include the supplier’s business name, address (including postcode) and telephone number</li>
    <li>be comparable with each other in terms of quality, size, quantity, units and specification for every item</li>
    <li>have been obtained within the last 9 months and still be valid</li>
    <li>be addressed to the applicant business or agent (containing the business name, business or project address, if different, and postcode)</li>
    <li>must clearly reference the project and its location if the quote is addressed to your agent</li>
    <li>include the original email if a supplier sent it as an attachment</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<br>

<p class="govuk-body">If your quote is not in £ sterling, you need to convert these to £ sterling in your application using <a href="/_common/not-testing.html">HMRC exchange rates (opens in a new tab)</a>. Any fees (including non-sterling transaction fees) are not eligible for grant funding.</p>

<br><br>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Uploading tenders</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">For large-scale and complex projects where you are proposing to use a formal tender process, you must provide:<br>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a detailed estimate of costs with explanation of the basis for these with independent evidence, for example a fully specified and costed project plan compiled by a chartered quantity surveyor or person of similar professional standing</li>
    <li>the basis of any assumptions used</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You must contact RPA to discuss this to make sure this is appropriate for your project and its timescales.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Send copies of the email(s) showing you contacted RPA about using a formal tendering process and it was agreed that you could.</p>


<br><br>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Uploading catalogue listings</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">Screenshots of catalogue listings must include:<br>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the date it was printed or copied</li>
    <li>the item description and price</li>
    <li>the name of the company or catalogue</li>
    <li>the page number or webpage</li>
  </ul>
</p>





<br><br>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cheapest quote</h3>
<span class="govuk-body">
  You are expected to use the cheapest supplier for each item.<br><br>
  Where a more expensive quote has been selected, we will base any grant on the value of the cheapest quote only.<br><br>
  You can still use a more expensive supplier but will be expected to fund the difference in cost yourself.<br><br>


</span>

<br><br>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you cannot supply the required evidence</h3>
    <span class="govuk-body">If you cannot provide the required number of quotes, references to catalogue listings or tenders for any item included in your project costs, you will need to explain why.</span>
