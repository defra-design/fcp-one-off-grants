<p class="govuk-body-l">Action you need to take to continue with your application.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">To continue with your application, you need to buy all the items listed in your grant funding agreement.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Before accepting your grant funding agreement, you should confirm with your supplier that the items are still available.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
    You must read and accept the agreement by 11:59pm on <strong>31 May 2024</strong> or the offer will expire and we cannot award you a grant.
</div>

<span class="content-section">
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you cannot buy all the items</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You must tell us as soon as possible if you cannot purchase the item you intended and cannot source it from another supplier or if you cannot meet the claim deadline.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We will consider amendment requests on a case-by-case basis. You must be able to demonstrate you have taken all reasonable steps to source the items within a realistic timeframe.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you remove an item, your application must still be above the minimum grant of Â£1,000.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The revised total amended score must still be more than the minimum threshold for the round. The cut off score for FETF 2023 was 75%. If you fall below this score your application will no longer be eligible for funding.</p>
